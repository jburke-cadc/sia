This is a simple SIA-2.0 implementation that constructs an ADQL query of the ivoa.ObsCore table and submist it to
a TAP service. It assumes the TAP /sync resource follows the POST-redirect-GET (PrG) pattern (SyncServlet in cadcUWS
follows this pattern) so it can submit the TAP job, capture the redirect, and then redirect the caller to get the
query result directly from the TAP service.

The TAP service URL is found by looking in a config file (SiaRunner.properties) that is found in the classpath. The sample
war file includes src/resources/SiaRunner.properties and thus looks up the CADC TAP service. The lookup itself is done
via the RegistryClient class in cadcResgitry; this is a simple config-file based "fake" registry lookup. If you change
the tapURI in SiaRunner.properties you will also need to make sure the URI is listed in the RegistryClient.properties config
file. The default config for that library is included in the jar file; you might be able to include a new 
RegistryClient.properties in WEB-INF/classes or you might have to replace the one in the jar file. This sort of thing
can all be done in the ant build file that constructs the war.

The sample war file built uses the MemoryJobPersistence implementation. You would need to implement your own JobManager and
configure it in the web.xml file to change that. 

Intended use: We use the cadcSIA.jar as a library and have a separate project to build and deploy the war file. That project
has our prefered JobManager implementation and config files.
